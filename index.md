# My Website Title 

My first website using Markdown and GitHub Pages.

## Links (Two hashes is a second level heading)

Here's a clickable link: [13 Fun Facts About Owls](https://www.audubon.org/news/13-fun-facts-about-owls)

## Images

Images look like links except with an exclamation directly in front

## Reminders

Use a dash space for unordered lists

- Spaces matter

- Spelling matters

- Capitalization matters
